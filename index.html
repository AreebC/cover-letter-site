    <div class="greeting">
        <p>Dear Hiring Manager,</p>
    </div>

    <div class="paragraph">
        <p>I am excited to apply for the DevOps apprenticeship with Masters and the Department of Work and Pensions. With a strong foundation in Linux, Bash, networking concepts
            ,Github, Docker, and a growing knowledge of AWS, Terraform, Ansible and Kubernetes, I am eager to contribute to and learn from your team while supporting secure,
        repeatable and scalable infrastructure. </p>
    </div>

    <div class="paragraph">
        <p>I have developed practical experience in coding and Devops princples through multiple projects hosted on my Github, highlighting my knowledge on developing code, containerisation,
            automation and pipelines. I wrote a basic Rock-Paper-Scissors game handling user input and game logic which I then improved by integrating a machine learning model to predict the 
            player's next move based on history. I have also implemented a neural network in Python to classify handwritten digits using the MNIST dataset which I then improved by adjusting
            parameters and experiemnting with optimisers to imporve accuracy. Both of these projects tested my ability to pinpoint errors and trouleshoot which was finalised through testing.
            The projects were fully containerised with Docker and are thoroughly documented with README files. This static CI/CD webpage showcases this cover letter as a live deployment, 
            demonstrating my understanding of automation, pipelines and infrastructure as code. 
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="paragraph">
        <p>These experiences have stengthened my skills in troubleshooting, version control, containerisation and automation whilst also developing a mindset of continuous improvement. 
            These are qualities I am eager to bring to your DevOps team. I am particularly excited about the opportunity to learn and implement Terraform and Ansible to manage infrastructure
            as code and to gain hands on experience with GitLab pipelines for CI/CD, supporting services for citizens and fellow engineers.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="paragraph">
        <p>I am interested in this apprenticeship because of your mission to deliver innovative and efficient services and I am confident that my initiative, technical foundation and passion
            for learning makes me a strong fit for this role.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="closing">
        <p>Thank you for considering my application. I welcome the opportunity to discuss further how my skills, projects and motivation align with your goals and how I can contribute to the 
            company.
        </p>
