# Cover Letter Webpage
This repository contains a live webpage of a cover letter. This project demonstrates my understanding of CI/CD, automation, containerisation and version control.

## Project Overview
- HTML and CSS language used to create a professional webpage designed to look like a letter
- CI/CD Pipeline: Github Actions workflow automatically deploys the site to Github Pages whenever changes are pushed to the main branch
- Automation and DevOps Principles: Demonstrating the development lifecycle:
    - Writing and updating code
    - Version Control with Git
    - Continuous Integration (Workflow triggered on push)
    - Continuous Deployment (Automatic deployment to Github Pages)
